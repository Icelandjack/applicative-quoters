applicative-quoters provides two quasiquoters to be used with
applicative functors: a do-notation-alike, ado, and an attempt to
emulate Conor McBride's idiom brackets.

They are originally taken from Matt Morrow's haskell-src-meta package,
before he disappeared forever and I took up maintainership of it.

However, I no longer maintain it, since it is unused even by me. If
you're interested in keeping it updated, feel free to take over.
