applicative-quoters provides two quasiquoters to be used with
applicative functors: a do-notation-alike, ado, and an attempt to
emulate Conor McBride's idiom brackets.

They are originally taken from Matt Morrow's haskell-src-meta package,
before he disappeared forever and I took up maintainership of it.

There is a known bug where building the shared library fails on GHCs
prior to 7.0.4 due to some strange TH magic.

- GHC 7.4 compatibility
